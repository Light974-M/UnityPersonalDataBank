# Dimension
powerful switch between every spatial or timed dimension in unity engine

## description :

allow you to fully control dimensions, you can in real time, trough value set or at runtime, reduce a dimension(spatial or timed) and make a fully add or delete dimension, choosing "intensity" of them, you can make for example :
-1D or 2D games
-no time games
-only time games
-4D games
-2 timed dimension games
-import a 4D object in a 4 or 3D engine
-import 3D objects in 4D engine
.
.
.

finally, this is compatible with object dimension, wich will allow you to make nD objects, that you will be able to import in the nD engine.
