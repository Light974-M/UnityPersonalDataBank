# SMPhysics
realistic slow motion engine

## description :

SMPhysic(slow motion physic) : extension for slow motions and bullet time
note : difference with custom time scale : this one use exactely custom time scale, but apply it to a tool that can easly provide intuitive way to render sound, animations, physic, or wathever you want, at a custom speed, layering and managing delta time and physics update, and even go further with a fully compatible layer of code for rigidbody that manage timescale with a simple value, you will be able to set same values that default timescale, or enable automatic mode to render physics update and choosing wich type of objects should be timescaled.
