## description :
```
Realistic Accurate Physics(RAPhysics) is a program that let you replace default physics engine gravity by a smooth realistic gravity, where every objects can attract each other depending on distance and mass.

THIS PROGRAM REPLACE RIGIDBODY'S GRAVITY, PLEASE DISABLE RIGIDBODY'S DEFAULT GRAVITY FIRSTLY.



TUTORIAL : 


create object and ad the UPDB's RAPhysic script, it will automatically create colliders, rigidbody, and the global values manager with physic strength multiplier(G constant) and the scriptable where is stored every object detected by game, where you can delete an object you don't want to interact with RAPhysic, list delete and add automatically object when you load/unload them.
