## description :
```
Realistic Accurate Physics(RAPhysics) is a program that let you replace default physics engine gravity by a smooth realistic gravity, where every objects can attract each other depending on distance and mass.

THIS PROGRAM REPLACE RIGIDBODY'S GRAVITY, PLEASE DISABLE RIGIDBODY'S DEFAULT GRAVITY FIRSTLY.
```


INSTALLATION : 


-create object and ad the UPDB's RAPhysic script, it will automatically create colliders, rigidbody, and the global values manager with physic strength multiplier(G constant) and the scriptable where is stored every object detected by game, where you can delete an object you don't want to interact with RAPhysic, list delete and add automatically object when you load/unload them.

-you can dynamically duplicate objects and create new, everything will work without any interventions, you can also move objects while playing to create some pathes.

-you can imulate atmosphere to any objects, applied like a spherical atmosphere(wich is the only atmosphere possible in real life physic) and manage distance of effective atmosphere and air density(with no limits)

-you can create realistic calculations between mass, matter density, and scale, if you set two values, game can automatically find the third values depending of the two others.
