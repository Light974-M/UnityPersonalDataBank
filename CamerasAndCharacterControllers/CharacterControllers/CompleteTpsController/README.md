## INSTALLATION : 

to Install completeTpsController, you can simply drag and drop character prefab made for this, however, if you need to understand all the options behind code, here is some steps to begin from scratch :


STEP 1 :

in a new scene(without camera), create an empty gameObject with the completeTpsController component, unity's characterController component, and a playerInput component(make sure you have input system package installed !)

STEP 2 :

take the new automatically created object "PlayerTargetPivot" and make sure its localPosition is to 0 0 0, and add your player mesh in it, in the GameObject of the mesh you just imported, add an animator controller and the complete tps anim controller, then, put the animator controller of the tool in the animator component
